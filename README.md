# transferlearning-robotics
This was the project I did under Prof. Doina Precupp. 

Abstract: Autonomous robots have achieved high levels of performance and reliability at specific tasks. However it is important for a robot agent to be able to adapt to the new environment and learn varying tasks. In Reinforcement learning agent learns by interacting with the environment and gathering data. Therefore learning different tasks in isolation can be very expensive for a physical agent both in terms of computation and actual physical cost of the Robot. Transfer learning can be used in such cases to learn in simulated environment and using the learned knowledge on actual physical robot to avoid damage as well as to speed up vanilla RL algorithms. This report focuses on understanding transfer learning problem in reinforcement learning domain and applying it to robot navigation task.
